# EKTA
A digital Odessey of India's diverse heritage and culture.

## The Idea
Our problem statement is to- Ideate a solution that showcases the rich cultural heritage and traditions of India. India boasts of a rich and diverse cultural heritage that spans thousands of years, encompassing art, music, dance, crafts, and more. Simultaneously, India is home to millions of skilled artisans and craftsmen who have been preserving and enriching this heritage.However, despite the immense cultural wealth and the talent of local artisans, there are several challenges that need to
be addressed:
1. Lack of awareness about the culture and heritage of India.
2. Lack of online visibility for the local artisans.
3. The untapped nooks of India offer a wealth of diverse experiences yet to be explored and shared globally.
Tourism, a goldmine of economic and cultural potential, often remains underexploited.
